- Another common argument for an afterlife is the specialness of consciousness.
    - Granted, consciousness is a strange concept. 
        - You are conscious (I hope, if you don't think you're conscious then definitely don't check out (P-zombies)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie]).
        - Yet it is difficult to verify that anyone else is as conscious as you are;
        - And more crucially, you are always conscious, and cannot persist in a state in which you are not consciousness (cue Descartes I think therefore I am).
    - Leaving aside the issue that on closer examination, counter-thought-experiments to the specialness of consciousness exist, the burden is to prove that just because consciousness is special, that is sufficient to necessitate the existence of an afterlife. 
        - One might think that consciousness is strange, and so is the afterlife; but there are may things which are equally as strange, and lumping them all into one connected bundle is asking too much of our cruel universe, in my humble opinion.


    - However, on closer examination, there are counter-thought-experiments to the two latter propositions.
    - For the first argument, that your consciousness is somehow special and distinct from anyone else's consciousness:
        - It is difficult to determine what (line to draw)[https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2013-01-25] between consciousness and non-consciouness;
        - One only needs to expose oneself to any other relatively well-educated and free-thinking human being to realise that they are most certainly not special in being able to evaluate their version of the human experience.
    - For the second argument, there are a number of instances where one can find temporary slips in their consciousness. 
        - For example, as I mentioned earlier, do you ever notice yourself going to sleep?
        - Have you ever noticed yourself acting on autopilot?
    - One final consideration to be made when talking about the notion of a persistent conscious element is the question of where the line should be drawn.
        - The following consideration is based on the notion that consciousness doesn't operate by the rules of our physical universe.  
        - If we agree that blastocysts (sperm + egg + 5 days) aren't conscious, and you are, at which point did consciousness come into play?
