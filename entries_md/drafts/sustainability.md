# Sustainability
- Something is sustainable if it adds value to a system.
- It is difficult for something that is not medium-term sustainable to become long-term sustainable.
## Asustainable
- There's an interesting class of activities that satisfy the following 5 criteria:
    - They prevent harm
    - The harm is directed at the public
    - The harm is long term
    - They do not otherwise produce value (satisfy a 'positive want').
    - They have a cost.
- These aren't unsustainable because they do provide value.
    - However, they aren't medium term sustainable, so they can't achieve sustainability.
    - I'd call them Asustainable. 
    - You might think "Can't is a strong word" - and can't is a strong word, but it is supported by strong forces: in particular, game theory.
- If there's a big problem in the world that hasn't been solved, the necessary actions are likely to fall in this category. Examples include:
    - Action against Global warming
    - Reducing Inequality
    - Mitigating against resource shortages
    - A system of perfect politics
- How can we solve these problems as individuals? 
    - We make the following assumptions:
        - We cannot reliably influence others' strategies
        - Everyone else wants to optimise their own return
        - People are generally similar in their desires.
    - Then, the actions we can take are:
        - Think selfish. Think about yourself: what solution to this problem would work for you? 
            - But don't be antagonistic! If you take enough that you need and don't have to take from others, then don't.
        - Offer value to others, by solving for everyone. 
            - The assumption here is that if a solution works for you, it will work for other people.
            - So, this problem is a potential value chain.
