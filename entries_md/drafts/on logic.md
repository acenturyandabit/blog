# On logic

## Definitions
- Logic, says wikipedia, is a study of the relations between sets of propositions.
    - The fundamental unit of logic is therefore a proposition.
    - The execution of logic results in the determination of the truthfulness of a given proposition, given some other propositions known to be true.
    - Propositions can be combined to form more complex propositions through combinations.
- When discussing logic, we take on a logical system, which requires the following parts:
    - A set of starting truth propositions. These are called Axioms.
    - A set of rules that determine the truthiness of subsequent propositions. 
        - These are also axioms, but they are more generalised, as in they can take two propositions and make a third, w    ith a given truth value.
        - Examples of these rules used in everyday logic include AND: if A is true and B is true, than  A and B together are true; but if A is true and B is not, then A and B are not true. 
            - I'm sure you can think of plenty more so I will not go into detail here, though I would point you to a book titled "Knowledge Representation and Reasoning" by a Ronald J. Brachman which I found very interesting.
- One more key thing about logic is the assumption of consistency.
    - Once something in a logical system is defined as true, it cannot later be defined as untrue. 
        - This seems like a rather simple assumption, but I'm sure you can find some examples where a self-proclaimed logical person is willing to accept two contradictory propositions as both untrue.
- There are lots of logical fallacies, and someone has already written a (very comprehensive article on it)[https://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/fallacies_list.html].

## The boundary of logic
- Logic is relational. 
    - A proposition that exists on its own cannot be determined to be true or false without assumption.
    - When disassembled, neither the logical rules in a logical system, nor the axioms of a logical system, can be determined to be true.
- As such, a proposition that is disconnected from any other proposition cannot be shown to be true or false, despite the existence of a rule system.
- Similarly, though less practically, a logical system without rules cannot be used to determine the truthfulness of a novel statement.
- Two logical systems with different axioms can result in a large subset of statements that both systems consider true, and still differ on others.
- Logic is binary, and doesn't deal well with ambiguity. 

## Logic hates ambiguity
- What is art? I could pull out the entire contents of my garage and splay it all over the street, and label it art. The local council will likely not share my definition; but if Banksy did the same it'd probably be passable as art.
- A small list of things that are art-like include:
    - Consciousness
