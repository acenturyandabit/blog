# Dealing with different axioms

## Defining an axiom
- Mathematically, an axiom is a statement upon which a system of proof is based. 
    - As such, it is impossible to prove or disprove an axiom using the same logical system that the axiom is defined.
    - A logical system is a system consisting of a set of axioms and a set of logical rules which can be used to validate novel statements based on the axioms of the system.
- If axioms are considered, one could define mental flexibility as one's ability to adopt others' axioms during reasoning.


## Differentiating factors between sets of axioms
- One of my axioms is that it is good to be able to compare different things.
- Hence, I shall endeavour to create a set of scales to compare different axiom sets.
- One scale I would propose is the number of axioms that one has. 
    - There are however two ways of interpreting a logical system with fewer axioms: either
        - the logical system has not been exposed to enough edge cases and is inexperienced; or
        - the axioms in the logical system are very flexible so as to be able to accommodate the variety of experiences it has encountered.
- Another scale would be the number of observations that the axiom is able to explain.
    - This requires the base axiom that 1) all observations are valid; and 2) all observations can be logically explained.

## A list of my personal axioms
- We live in a society. 
- The concept of 'nothing' is not worth considering.
- Issues that are closer to directly impacting me are more worth my attention.
- I cannot substantially alter anyone else's axioms.
- I prefer truths that will stand to benefit me physically over ones that do not. 

## A list of axioms I do not agree with
- There is an objectively correct way of interpeting the world that all parties necessarily agree to.
    - Subclauses of this axiom include any axiom of the form 'Absolutely everyone agrees that ...'
- There is an objective moral system external to the immediate performer of any action.
    - This includes any sort of religious sense of 'right'.

## How to deal with different axioms
- Two logical systems with different axioms can still produce the same results.
- If two indivdiuals' logical rules are consistent, then from any set of commonly agreed truths, subsequently derived truths can be derived, if the derivations do not involve any other axioms that conflict. 
- If my axioms are more clearly elaborated than those of another version of me, then I will find it easier to quickly understand which axioms I share with third party, and hence deduce whether or not the other person will agree with a fact that I propse.
