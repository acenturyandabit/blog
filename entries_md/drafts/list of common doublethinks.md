"Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them."

In George Orwell's 1984, the primary regulation mechanism of the elite members of the authoritarian Ingsoc is Doublethink - the ability to hold two contradictory beliefs simultaneously and accept both. 

Even though Orwell portrays doublespeak as evil, i'd argue that it is essential for our continuation as individuals and as a species. 

The assumptions that this is based on is that A) life ends, someday; B) it is desirable to stay alive; and C) for something to be considered meaningful it must persevere. 


















# I'm a special snowflake
Spoilers: I'm not; or at least, not one that necessarily is aligned with your particular needs.

I think there are a number of congitive dimensions that I score higher on compared to others, that's all. 

Here's some congitive dimensions I rate myself in:
- Spatial awareness: 5/10. 
    - Most of my family has aphantasia (lower end of this scale). 
    - I do not. I can wrestle with mental objects, and visually imagine a rubber duck on my table (arbitrarily). 
    - I have also met people with photographic memory (higher end of this scale.)
- Attention span: 4/10.
    - I tend to get distracted up to every 90s if there is a viable distraction nearby and I am not focused on my current task.
    - I can focus on work if I am interested in the results and have a flow to progress with.
    - I can focus on gaming intensely, hours at a time.
- Memory: 3/10.
    - I can rarely remember things accurately.
    - It takes me effort to remember things.
    - I can usually remember a fact accurately after getting it wrong around three times over the span of a few months.
- Algorithmical thinking: 5/10.
    - I have met people who find great difficulty determining the outcome of a program.
    - I can debug simple algorithms very effectively.
    - My brother can identify use cases for complex algorithms in half the time it takes me.
- Teaching: 
    - 
- Generative:
    - 
- Self-regulation: 
    - Awareness of desired baseline
    - Strategies to return to desired baseline
- Empathy: 5/10
    - I am quite hopeless at concealing my emotions. My face alone gives away my emotional state.
    - I am however apparently am good at empathising with others in written situations, if you'll believe my medical exam scores.
- Metacognition:
    - I do a lot of self reflection. 
    - I try to prevent myself from overthinking by keeping logs (like this one!)
