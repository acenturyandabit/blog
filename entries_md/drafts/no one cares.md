# No one cares
- A number of people I am friends with have come to the conclusion that:
    1. No-one cares about them
    2. The fact that no-one cares about them is inevitable
    3. The fact that no-one cares about them is desirable, because it is inevitable.
- However, if this is universally true, what of celebrities and influencers? How come people care about them?
    1. They spend a nontrivial amount of resources (time, advertising dollars) getting people to care about them
    2. They might just be lucky in that the multiplier of how much people care about them is increased. Maybe they look good or something.
- What is the problem per se?
    1. I feel disappointed in myself that I cannot be as successful / cared about as they are.
    2. I feel guilty that I am being facetious about followers.
    3. I am aware that one factor that contributes to my influence is my followership
        - Hence I am not as confident to accept that no-one cares is a desirable state of being.
- What are some things that I can do in this space?
    1. Figure out how to advertise myself well.
        - This may be a function of figuring out what people want (to follow).
    2. Bucketloads of self care.
