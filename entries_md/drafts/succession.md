Success!

Now that I have your attention: I'd like to ask you: Who is your successor? Who do you succeed? 

To be a good successor, you need to be working towards the same thing as your mentor. You must have the dedication to read through your mentor's accumulations, which may span more than a single lifetime's worth of work, but still have enough energy near the end to dig deeper. 

I don't think I've done this. What's stopping me? What topics would I be willing to succeed? A few things come to mind: 
- Marvin Minsky and his theories on machine cognition
- SNES: Strategies for Negligible Engineered Senescence (or: how to live forever)
- Cyclical economies (If anyone has articles they know of that address this subject, please let me know.)

To be a good mentor, you need to sacrifice your time and your explorations to pass down the baton to the next in line. "Leadership success is measured by the success of your successor" says Myles Munroe; and although I may not agree with his views entirely, I think that intergenerational leadership is just as important as leadership in the present. 

I'll confess that I have not been a great mentor. I used to do robotics in high school, and our team in the day was quite successful, but I failed in teaching my successors how to design and operate robots the same way our team did. Compounded with a few organisational difficulties, the robotics club was lost to time.
