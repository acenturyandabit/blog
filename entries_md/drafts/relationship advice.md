# Relationship advice
Before we start:
- People think love is sacred, and for this reason, it is controversial to have a solid stance on love. 
- I think that that is counterproductive to knowledge and human development.
- Hence, here I am describing aspects of a relationship.

Practical perks of a relationship:
- reduced living expenses per capita, due to shared expenses
- someone to take care of you when bad things happen

Downsides to a relationship:
- You have to take care of someone when bad things happen
- Emotional labour

## How to get into a (long term) relationship
- Build a future together. Create a future that you agree on.

## How to 'get over' someone
- Realise that love is a chemical reaction. Use this opportunity to develop metacognition.
- There are two pathways to metacognition: 
    1. There exists some immortal spiritual part of you that you can reach out to by cutting out the universe and focusing on nothing.
    2. Mind is software. We are programs capable of altering our software in certain ways. We can correct and improve ourselves.
- I personally take the second approach. Exercise sheer will.
