# I'm a special snowflake
Spoilers: I'm not; or at least, not one that necessarily is aligned with your particular needs.

I think there are a number of congitive dimensions that I score higher on compared to others, that's all. 

Here's some congitive dimensions I rate myself in:
- Spatial awareness: 5/10. 
    - Most of my family has aphantasia (lower end of this scale). 
    - I do not. I can wrestle with mental objects, and visually imagine a rubber duck on my table (arbitrarily). 
    - I have also met people with photographic memory (higher end of this scale.)
- Attention span: 4/10.
    - I tend to get distracted up to every 90s if there is a viable distraction nearby and I am not focused on my current task.
    - I can focus on work if I am interested in the results and have a flow to progress with.
    - I can focus on gaming intensely, hours at a time.
- Memory: 3/10.
    - I can rarely remember things accurately.
    - It takes me effort to remember things.
    - I can usually remember a fact accurately after getting it wrong around three times over the span of a few months.
- Algorithmical thinking: 5/10.
    - I have met people who find great difficulty determining the outcome of a program.
    - I can debug simple algorithms very effectively.
    - My brother can identify use cases for complex algorithms in half the time it takes me.
- Teaching: 
    - 
- Generative:
    - 
- Self-regulation: 
    - Awareness of desired baseline
    - Strategies to return to desired baseline
- Empathy: 5/10
    - I am quite hopeless at concealing my emotions. My face alone gives away my emotional state.
    - I am however apparently am good at empathising with others in written situations, if you'll believe my medical exam scores.
- Metacognition:
    - I do a lot of self reflection. 
    - I try to prevent myself from overthinking by keeping logs (like this one!)
