# God is you
You follow Emily down a cobblestone spiral staircase, which opens up to a concrete-walled room which must have been an old monasterial bunk. The walls are lit up with the purple glow of disinfectant lamps, and a sharp, bleachy odour stings your nose. 

Emily takes a seat at a computer on top of an office desk. The screen is showing a few sentences that you can't quite make sense of. You instead trace the wires leading out from the computer which lead to what looks like a medical examination bench. Next to the table is a bank of monitors, waiting for a signal, which you presume would come from a rather improvised-looking colandar helmet resting on the bench.

"What is this place?" you ask. Emily asks you to take a seat, and you find that there is nothing else to sit on besides the examination table. Suddenly, you don't feel so safe, but you trust her, so you oblige. "Am I meant to, uh, put this on?" you ask, picking up the helmet. It is heavier than you expect.

Emily shakes her head. "Not yet, Ashley. Let's go for a few questions first. What's your occupation?" 

You realise you're not sure. Did you hit your head? You look for the answer in your head, but something feels missing. You're in a church, and it feels like night-time, and you've got this security costume on. Right, you're probably a security officer for the church. "I'm a security officer for the church, I think. I'm feeling a little light-headed right now, actually. Did something happen to me?" 

You can't see Emily's face as she is looking at the computer, but you hear her suppress something (a chuckle?), and clear her throat. "Ah, yes, you bumped your head on one of the pews when you came in here. Let me know if you feel funny, alright?" 

You nod, feeling somewhat reassured. You answer her question with a question: "Really though, what did I sign up for again?" 

Emily sighs, sounding a little exhausted. It is rather late. She says: "I asked you to come down from the church so you could help me test my machine. You said you didn't mind, so you followed me down here, but you tripped and hit your head on a pew. I guess I should explain what this machine does again." You nod. "This machine controls human perception. Our brains are made up of cascades of electrical signals, and if we stimulate them in the right way, we can speed up and slow down time, and add or remove memories as we see fit. I'm pretty sure it's ready, I just need a volunteer. And you said you'd help, so..."

You suppose you trust yourself, even though you can't remember agreeing to the experiment. "Ok then," you declare, "what next?"

Emily asks: "What do you think about god?" Noticing your readiness to answer, she adds: "Think about it a little. We're doing this to check your value systems, and see if they'll change once we run the experiment." 

Something doesn't feel right. You've watched enough movies to know what's probably gone down. You feel your heartbeat getting faster. "Wait," you say: "We've done this before, haven't we?" You stand up, and approach Emily who is still seated at her desk. "You've used that - thing on me, right? That's why I can't remember - "

Emily interrupts, standing to meet your stature. "Whoa, hey, slow down officer! I wish this machine was that powerful. You've hit your head, that's all. Maybe you need some rest." You give in to her voice. She's
