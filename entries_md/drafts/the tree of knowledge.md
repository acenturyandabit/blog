# The tree of human experience




# The difficulty of novel enterprise
## Assumptions
- We start with the same aim as the [[nihilism article]]; which I shall reiterate:
    - We have a set of actions we can choose to take; 
    - through self-reflection we aim to choose actions that are worthwhile. 
- We also are aware that we live in a society, and must obey the laws of [[societal economics, or why everything still sucks]].
    - Power and rewards concentrate.
    - Beyond our basic needs, all sustainable value systems are socially derived.

## Self-evident stuff out of the way
- 

## All the low hanging fruit are gone
- Let us construct a spectrum of project ideas; sorted along two axes: 
    - how many people have thought about them before; and 
    - how many people, if committed, could achieve this goal.
- We define low hanging fruit as items which fall within the upper regions of the two axes.
    - The first axis implies that low hanging fruit are nonspecific or everyday.
    - The second axis implies that low hanging fruit are relatively low skill or relatively intuitive.
- There is one final assumption we need to make: once an idea is 'taken', it is infeasible for a competitor to come in and try that same idea in the same context.

## The lingering temptation of low hanging fruit
- Excuse me for continuing the fruit metaphor.
    - Imagine you aren't shown the tree upon which the fruit hang. 
    - Instead, you are shown people who bear large, glowing fruit in their hands.
    - Assuming you want fruit, you might think to go to the place where they found their fruit and get picking. 
        - So you start making that app / video series / whichever.
    - By the time you get there, however, you're expecting fruit of your own, only to find that the branches are empty. 
        - Your coveted profits / audience have all been taken already in that first large, glowing fruit.
- What would you tell someone in this predicament? Where would you interfere?
    - You could explain to them that the fruit has already been taken;
        - but they would likely refute your claim, telling you that they've seen plenty of people holding these fruit.
        - If you try and reach out to them with statistics (how many people have actually held these fruits? out of the people you know exist?)
            - they may retort with the claim [[I am special]].
    - You could show them the tree.
        - Then this raises the question: do you see the tree yourself? 

## The tree
- Let's ground the metaphor for a moment. What exactly is this tree I am talking about?
- I opened by asking you to consider a spectrum of project ideas with the intention of illustrating what a low hanging fruit was; let us look at these project ideas in their own right.
    - Any action taken is taken in response to a problem. 
    - Contrapositively, without a problem there will be no action.
    - Variety in action requires different ways of thinking.
- So if we seek to consider the spectrum of all ideas, we could trace their origins to the problems (and associated ways of thinking) they are derived from.
- With this in mind, we have a set of relations: problem -> solution, and inspiration -> solution. 
    - This leaves little room for growth however, because there are no cycles in our relationships. 
    - Furthermore, evidently, the world is not so simple such that every problem has a perfect solution.
- We may, with experience, uncover some more relations; for example, problem / solution -> awareness; awareness -> additional problems / ways of thinking -> solutions.
    - Great! We have a way of breeding more problems from our initial set of problems through analysis or experimentation.
- If we imagine all of these connections as branches, arranged chronologically from a trunk, we have a tree made up of problems, solutions, facts, and connections between these.

### Some assertions made about the tree
- A friend of mine called Bobby told me once that every idea has already been taken. 
    - What he says is true, if he is sitting in the dense centre of the tree. All around him he is are surrounded by leaves; and if he never moves from his perch towards the outside, you could be forgiven for believing that every idea has been taken. 
- The tree takes effort to climb.
- You do not need to 
- It is easier to climb the tree with guidance.


## Teaching as making ladders

## Enterprise

    - The aim here is to determine 
    - A friend of mine, Bobby, believes that every idea has been had before. To some extent what he's saying is true - but it only applies to problems that the majority of people can see. 
    - Trees have nodes and edges. When you have an education you climb higher up the tree.
    - Trees have a root - this is the starting set of problems that people have. 
    - The metaphor breaks down a little when you consider some paths as being solved.

## Me, the tree, and my telephone poll
- Disclaimer: Sticking to this metaphor, whilst writing this, I'm not really on the tree. 
    - I'm holed up on top of a telephone pole next to the tree, watching people running over to the lower branches, looking for scraps.
    - To be precise, at the moment of writing, I am watching one such person; though I see the ghost of my former self wanting to develop an 'everything app' and wanting to get into stocks for easy money running around down there too.
- Why a telephone pole?
