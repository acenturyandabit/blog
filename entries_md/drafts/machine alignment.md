## Machine alignment
- Question: When designing an all-powerful machine intelligence, what should the machine intelligence try to achieve?
    - Propsective answer: nothing. Well then, you might as well not.
    - Prospective answer: maintain your standard of living. This feels dangerous - what if it decides 'you' are your brainstem and extracts your brain to be put in a vat of dopamine?
    
    - Propsective answer: we don't know yet but we'll make sure it asks us before it does anything, and is aware of our awareness of the consequences of the action.

well, that was easier done than thought about 3: ... or was it?
