# On self-determination theory
- This is a sequel to my [intrinsic motivation](/blog/entries/on%20intrinsic%20motivation) post, based on a recommendation Ehssan gave me shortly after I shared the inital post with him.
- I am examining the presentation of the work by the Center for Self Determination Theory, at [this address](https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/the-theory/).
    - I feel no need to break down the article sentence by sentence; so I will instead summarise the points presented.
## A point summary of SDT
- SDT is a theory.
- SDT believes that:
    - A definition of internal motivation exists, and should be defined as:
        - motivations stemming from:
            - Interests;
            - Curiosity;
            - Care;
            - Abiding values;
        - and distinct from:
            - reward systems;
            - grades;
            - evaluations;
            - the opinions they think others have of them.
        - and having the ability to:
            - sustain passions, creativity and sustained effort;
            - influence differences in cognitive and social development.
    - that EVERY INDIVIDUAL 
        - shares a basic and universal need for
            - autonomy;
            - competence;
            - relatedness;
        - these needs are most effective in shaping their:
            - engagement for activities;
            - performance
            - persistence
            - creativity
            - and other facets of intrinsic motivation
        - These may be confounded when the pillars are disrupted by their social context.
            - (but not necessarily additionally supported if the pillars are provided!)
    - People are biologically evolved to 
        - grow,
        - master ambient challenges,
        - integrate new experiences into a coherent sense of self.
    - People require ongoing social support for these developments.
        - if these needs are not fulfilled they can result in:
            - defensiveness
            - lack of (social e.g. isolationism? or experiential e.g. narcissism?) integration
            - compulsive seeking of need-substitutes. 
    - To make any predictions, one must be aware of the social context in which an individual has lived.
    - That a good state to be in is one which the individual is
        - effectively functioning;
        - not psychopathic;
        - not prejudiced;
        - not aggressive.
    - The following types of results should be considered:
        - the results of motivational studies;
        - generalised observations of volition, initiative, wellbeing, and performance;
        - social and cultural factors.
- SDT has allegedly been noticed within families, classrooms, teams, organizations, clinics, and cultures.
- There are also 6 mini theories which SDT promotes, including:
    1. CET: cognitive evaluation theory:
        - that says that social contexts affect the formation of intrinsic motivators;
        - and that rewards, interpersonal controls, and ego-involvements impact intrinsic motivation and interest.
            - interpersonal controls are defined as attempts others make to influence one's will.
            - ego-involvements are "the extent to which a task or other target of judgment is perceived as psychologically significant or important to one's self-esteem". 
        - and that depleting competence and autonomy diminishes intrinsic motivation.
    2. OIT
        - Extrinsic motivations see the performance of tasks as instrumental goals.
        - Instrumental goals lie on a spectrum of internalization
            - on the spectrum are:
                - external regulation, 
                - introjection, 
                - identification,
                - integration
            - the more internalised you think your actions will be, the more autonomous you will behave.
        - internalisation can be thwarted by:
            - 
    3. COT

## A map on SDT's findings
Based on [this article](https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/SDT/documents/2010_MollerDeci_GPIR.pdf).


## My thoughts
- Ever since reading a psychology 101 ive seen psychology as a field that relates an individual's development and their society.
    - SDT seems to fit under that banner. That is to say, SDT should not be used as a fast-acting intervention tool; rather than a diagnostic tool for when things went wrong.
- If we agree with the SDT definition of intrinsic motivation, we still have a burden to prove that by selling the awareness of SDT, we can produce better outcomes in individuals, in an intervention activity.
    - we can get people to ditch 'bad things' or be aware of bad things like:
        - ego-involvements
            - but then what is the difference between ego invovlements and intrinsic motivation? they both motivate you...
                - also this leaves the question: can multiple motivational sources co-exist?
                    - e.g. are curiosity and 'i need to get this work done otherwise i'll fail' coexist?
                    - which is 'better'?
        - recognise interpersonal controls
    - we may be able to diagnose things like
        - depletion of competence and autonomy
    - whether or not we can supplement these things is another issue.
- SDT doesn't talk about alignment.
    - SDT assumes that it is fine if everyone does whatever they want to do
        - it provides no means of explicilty manipulating others, in case you would need to.

2. Organismic Integration Theory (OIT), the second mini-theory, addresses the topic of extrinsic motivation in its various forms, with their properties, determinants, and consequences. Broadly speaking, extrinsic motivation is behavior that is instrumental—that aims toward outcomes extrinsic to the behavior itself. Yet, there are distinct forms of instrumentality, which include external regulation, introjection, identification, and integration. These subtypes of extrinsic motivation are seen as falling along a continuum of internalization. The more internalized the extrinsic motivation, the more autonomous the person will be when enacting the behaviors. OIT is further concerned with social contexts that enhance or forestall internalization—that is, with what conduces toward people either resisting, partially adopting, or deeply internalizing values, goals, or belief systems. OIT particularly highlights supports for autonomy and relatedness as critical to internalization.

3. Causality Orientations Theory (COT), the third mini-theory, describes individual differences in people’s tendencies to orient toward environments and regulate behavior in various ways. COT describes and assesses three types of causality orientations: the autonomy orientation in which persons act out of interest in and valuing of what is occurring; the control orientation in which the focus is on rewards, gains, and approval; and the impersonal or amotivated orientation characterized by anxiety concerning competence.

4.  Basic Psychological Needs Theory (BPNT) is the fourth mini-theory and elaborates the concept of evolved psychological needs and their relations to psychological health and well-being. BPNT argues that psychological well-being and optimal functioning is predicated on autonomy, competence, and relatedness.  Therefore, contexts that support versus thwart these needs should invariantly impact wellness. The theory argues that all three needs are essential and that if any is thwarted there will be distinct functional costs. Because basic needs are universal aspects of functioning, BPNT looks at cross-developmental and cross-cultural settings for validation and refinements.

5. Goal Contents Theory (GCT), the fifth mini-theory, grows out of the distinctions between intrinsic and extrinsic goals and their impact on motivation and wellness. Goals are seen as differentially affording basic need satisfactions and are thus differentially associated with well-being. Extrinsic goals such as financial success, appearance, and popularity/fame have been specifically contrasted with intrinsic goals such as community, close relationships, and personal growth, with the former more likely associated with lower wellness and greater ill-being.

6. Relatedness, which has to do with the development and maintenance of close personal relationships such as best friends and romantic partners as well as belonging to groups, is one of the three basic psychological needs. Relationships Motivation Theory (RMT), the sixth mini-theory, is concerned with these and other relationships, and posits that some amount of such interactions is not only desirable for most people but is in fact essential for their adjustment and well-being because the relationships provide satisfaction of the need for relatedness. However, research shows that not only is the relatedness need satisfied in high-quality relationships, but the autonomy need and to a lesser degree the competence need are also satisfied. Indeed, the highest quality personal relationships are ones in which each partner supports the autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs of the other.

Other Topics of Interest
As SDT has expanded, both theoretical developments and empirical findings have led SDT researchers to examine a plethora of processes and phenomena integral to personality growth, effective functioning, and wellness. For example, SDT research has focused on the role of mindfulness as a foundation for autonomous regulation of behavior, leading to both refined measurement and theorizing about awareness. The study of facilitating conditions for intrinsic motivation led to a theory and measurement strategy regarding vitality, an indicator of both mental and physical wellness. Work on vitality also uncovered the remarkable positive impact of the experience of nature on well-being. Some research within SDT has more closely examined the forms personal passions can take, with individuals being obsessive or harmonious as a function of internalization processes. Cross-cultural tests of SDT have led to an increased understanding of how economic and cultural forms impact the invariant aspects of human nature. Research on wellness has also led to new theory and research on the assessment of well-being itself, including the distinction between hedonic and eudaimonic forms of living. Specific topics such as autonomy versus controlled motivation has led to greater understanding of internalized control such as ego-involvement and contingent self-esteem and of the differences between them and autonomous self-regulation. Indeed these few examples supply just a taste of how the generative framework of SDT has enhanced research on a variety of processes of interest to the field.

Applications
In addition to formal theory development, research has applied SDT in many domains including education, organizations, sport and physical activity, religion, health and medicine, parenting, virtual environments and media, close relationships, and psychotherapy. Across these domains research has looked at how controlling versus autonomy-supportive environments impact functioning and wellness, as well as performance and persistence. In addition, supports for relatedness and competence are seen as interactive with volitional supports in fostering engagement and value within specific settings, and within domains of activity. This body of applied research has led to considerable specification of techniques, including goal structures and ways of communicating that have proven effective at promoting maintained, volitional motivation.

The varied articles on this website demonstrate the many types of inquiry associated with the SDT framework, as well as its generative capacity with respect to practical issues in human organizations of all kinds. Relevant research reports and theoretical discussion are listed in the Publications section, organized by topic.

By focusing on the fundamental psychological tendencies toward intrinsic motivation and integration, SDT occupies a unique position in psychology, as it addresses not only the central questions of why people do what they do, but also the costs and benefits of various ways of socially regulating or promoting behavior. Overviews of the theory can be found in Ryan and Deci (2000) and in Deci and Ryan (1985, 2000), as well as numerous other articles and chapters identified here on our website.
