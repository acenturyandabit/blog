# Getting started with trading stocks
- Trading is a form of investment.
- In investment, you put in some capital and expect some return.
    - In a bank, you put in money and recieve interest.
    - In a stock market, you put in money and receive dividends (i.e. a share of a company's profits.

## Day Trading vs Long term trading
- There are two primary kinds of trading: day trading, and long term trading.
    - The resources you put in in each are different.
        - In day trading, the primary resource you put in is your effort (and your willingness to take risk). 
        - In long term trading, the primary resources you put in is your money (capital). 
            - You would typically collect dividends in long term trading but not in day trading.
    - The time period is different.
        - In day trading, you might buy and sell a stock on the same day, in the hopes of cashing in on a short term gain.
        - In long term trading, you would typically hold for over a year, to avoid capital gains tax.
    - Although the profits (if any) come a lot faster, day trading costs a lot more because you have to pay brokerage for each trade (unless you're a big company); and this can be nontrivial.

## The 'true value' of a stock
- A common myth I've heard is that you can lose ALL your money if you buy stocks, and that stocks have no 'true' value.
    - So I'm going to take a moment to explain the true value of a stock.
- (One of) the most secure financial assets is a bank account. 
    - Say I put $1000 in a bank account, and the interest rate is 1%; then I would expect to earn $10 in a year.
- Now, assume I have a company XYZ, and the company makes $10 in profit each year. If you want to buy my company, how much would you pay?
    - If I charged you any more than $1000, then you might as well put your money in a bank. Then the upper limit of my company's worth is $1000, if we both agree that it'll make $10 of profit in a year.
    - You might even go a little less, if you think my company will only make say $9 a year; or you might be willing to pay more if you think my company will make more money.
- Thus, the 'true value' of a company is equal to the equivalent amount of money that would be equal to its profit if it just sat in a bank account.
    - Therefore, unless a company is unable to make any profit, its stocks do have 'true' value, contrary to what some people may believe.
    - There is also a factor of risk; so that you might pay less money for higher return on the basis that the company has a small chance of falling through.

## What you need to get started
- In terms of capital: there is no minimum requirement on how much you will need to get started.
    - The limiting factor however is brokerage; i.e. the amount that the stockbroker charges you to buy a stock on your behalf.
    - Typical brokerages are around $10 per trade under 1k; and increase for amounts more than 1k. 
    - Hence, if you put in trades of just under 1k, you are paying 1% commission; but if you put in trades of $100, you are paying 10% commission.
- Steps to get started:
    1. Open a trading account.
        - The lowest brokerage I've heard of is IG trading.
        - I see ads for eToro but not sure how legit they are.
        - My parents recommend banks because they're allegedly more trustworthy. Allegedly. They also charge a slightly higher brokerage though.
    2. Research what stocks you want to buy. Things to consider include:
        - Risk: 
            - Typically, the more an individual stock is worth, the less risky it is; for example, if you buy a $100 stock, a 1c change means nothing, compared to a $1 stock where a 1c change means a lot.
            - Risk is also dependent on the total market value of a company (the 'market cap', = the stock price x the number of stocks). Lower market cap = higher risk.
        - Dividend:
            - Does the company pay dividends? If it does, it's more likely to be secure and in the position to pay dividends later.
        - Long term prospects.
    3. Place a buy order.
    4. Hold on, until you anticipate a dip that you won't recover from.
    5. Sell.

## Tips for buying
- DON'T see a stock that has just gone up and buy it. It's probably overvalued and will go down in the next couple of hours/days. 
- DON'T just buy stocks that have gone down drastically either.
- Ideally, do some research on a company:
    - Make sure that they aren't going bankrupt;
    - Check their Profit/Equity ratio. A high P/E ratio may indicate that they're making a lot of profit; but it may also indicate that they're borrowing a lot and have more debt instead of equity. High P/E roughly corresponds to a stable company.
- Then, wait for the stock to go down a bit.
    - Then, buy the stock.
- Trading is unlike normal shopping in that there is no 'agreed upon' price that lasts for more than a few minutes.
    - This means that if you tell your stockbroker to buy something for say $1.00, they might buy it at $0.99 if the market moves down after you submit your trade;
    - or they might not find anyone willing to sell if the market moves up.

## What happens when it goes down
- If your stocks have gone down, but none of the above things have happened:
    - the company has announced it is literally going bankrupt (in which case, save for a miracle, your stocks are worthless and you should dispose of them)
    - there is a major recession that is probably not going to get better in the next few days
- then, HOLD ON! Your stock will likely recover.
- Remember: if you sell, it'll cost brokerage; so selling is effectively betting that the value of your stock will continue to go down by at least 2x$10 (i.e. the amount you'll pay to sell and buy again) within the next few days.


## Cashing out
- Expect to get a little less than the quoted value of your portfolio when you decide to sell everything.
    - This is because as I mentioned, there is no instantaneous agreed-upon price - you may have to sell for a few cents less in order to cash out immediately.

## Using my mock platform
[Advice ends here. This is an ad for my platform, just a disclaimer]
- Compared to other platforms, my platform:
    - I don't take email addresses or bank details, and I will try not to ever. (it's a pain to store them securely anyways
    - You don't pay real cash.
    - I don't know what your portfolio looks like; I don't send your data anywhere.
    - I don't use a 'fake stock market' - there's no such thing. Stocks are very much tied to real life; so I don't see the point of 'training' on a random number generator.
    - You can get started right away, and come back anytime.
