# Criticisms of the All-In-One business plan
- I was working for streamplate, which aims to be an all in one food ordering / recommendation app
- I internally criticise their model of wanting to perform multiple pre-existing functions at once
- I then realised that my own product, polymorph, seeks to do the same thing
    - Therefore, to be logically consistent, I must either critique polymorph in greater detail, or 
    - find some difference between polymorph and streamplate.
- I chose the former, to critique polymorph (and streamplate)'s approach.

## The necessary axioms for the pursuit for all-in-one
- Polymorph was likely envisioned on the same principle as streamplate, i.e. that one app could perform all the functions of multiple apps; and that that would be a valid selling point.
- The cost of performing multiple functions in a single app is that you aren't the go-to for any one function in particular;
    - especially if you are competing with many established apps. 
- Polymorph and streamplate are both founded upon the assumption that people will give up their existing routines in order to adopt a new all in one app.
    - This assumption is dependent on a number of smaller assumptions, including that
        - the cost to change between different systems is percieved as trivial;
        - users will intuitively know everything they want to do the moment they pick a particular service to form part of a suite to use, rather than discovering features they want progressively.
- The first assumption that the cost to change between different systems is percieved as trivial is flawed not only because of human resistance to change, but also
    - That companies actively seek to increase retention and loyalty, 
        - whether by utilising pre-existing data from their users, or 
        - being more convenient for users by encouraging quick access e.g. downloads.
- The second assumption that users will intuitively know everything they want to do from the first choice they make is also flawed, at least from an experiential point of view.
    - In polymorph's case, say I had wanted to sign up a company on the basis that polymorph is the 'ultimate idea management tool, with a lot of features like sharing, chat, and complete ui customisability'. 
        - The user, however, wants a project management app right now, and is likely to go for asana or trello or the like; and if later they want chat features they will go to something with chat features.

## Counterexamples
- But wait! you say, Didn't company so-and-so do this model?
    - Well, let's look at all the successful companies that are a 'one stop shop for all x'. 
        - We have: Amazon, which is the one stop shop for buying stuff;
            - But it started back in the day when there was no, well, Amazon. You couldn't pull off something like this today because Amazon, the establishment, is already so powerful.
        - We have: Uber spilling into uber eats.
            - But we must remember that uber's initial market was taxi rides. 
            - Uber got really good at taxi rides first, 
            - and it took either a whole subdivision or 
            - a whole 5 years (from uber in 2009 to uber eats in 2014)
            - (or both!) in order to develop uber eats.
            - Also, neither uber nor uber eats is turning a profit, and it is questionable as to whether they ever will.
- Are there any truly lean startups that have become a 'one stop shop for all x'? I don't think so.

- So how do we get around this?
    - We can open up with a very clear focus on a specific niche, and then branch out later, much like Uber and Amazon did 
        - But we must keep in mind that when they opened, there were no established businesses which leveraged the power of the internet.
    - I would like to do further research on Amazon's model, to see how they broke out.
    - I would like to do further research on Uber, to see how and why they decided to disrupt the Taxi industry, and what analogous industries are ripe for disruption.
