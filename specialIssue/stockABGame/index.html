# Can you outwit the stock market?
- Whilst discussing the stock market, a friend of mine, Baha Ansari, told me that: "The price in the stock market reflects all known information - you can't predict the stock market." (I'm paraphrasing.)
- Not wanting to believe the huge price jumps/falls one sees from time to time on the stock market are unpredictable, I set out to prove him wrong.
- Below is the result of my labour:
    - I looked to the last 10 years of ASX data, and identified moments when a stock rose/fell by more than 3 z-score from the mean of the day.
    - I filtered this based on companies that were only currently worth more than $100 million, to keep things relevant
    - I then went to google and asked it for search results for the companies up to one month before the price jump occured. (Naturally, one can only view historical news from a time period.)
    - The results are as below.
- The game is, then, to use the links provided to try and predict whether or not the stock price of the company below went up, or down.
- Can you predict the market?
    - Data is available on request - email me or dm me or something if you want access. (Or, just take it right off this site, if you know how :) )
