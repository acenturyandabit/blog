# An alternative to the Socialist miracle: Universal Basic Resource
- This post assumes that:
    - You are familiar with the harms of capitalism;
        - If you want a refresher, and you dont mind a bit of melodrama, I recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG37wwhbS88).
    - You are familiar with socialism's definition of upper and lower class as
        - upper class = people who make their income by returns on factors of production
        - lower class = people who sell their labour (whether skilled or unskilled).

## The socialist miracle
- For the sake of this article, we will define a miracle as an event that is rather unlikely but it would be great if it happened.
- Socialism depends on a miracle, that one day the working class will coordinate, rise, and realise that they shouldn't be fighting each other and sieze the means of production, despite:
    - being worked to the brink of exhaustion;
    - mass media and cultural control, driving a culture of competition;
    - the fact that even a university group project of 4 people can't have an aligned vision.
- Miracles are necessary to change the system, because capitalism is nash equilibrium stable; i.e. no individual has an incentive to deviate from participating in their role in capitalism in the medium term without suffering some sort of loss.

## The miracle for Universal Basic Resource (and why its more realistic)
- Socialism advocates for state ownership of factors of production.
    - Universal Basic Resource is the opposite of socialism in this regard: it believes we can provide a minimal set of factors of production to the lower class, so that every individual can sustain themselves.
- Lower Class Erasure's miracle is a new technology that is simulatenously able to replicate itself, as well as provide for the basic needs of an individual.
- Why is LCA more realistic than socialism?
    - It preserves private ownership, which folds nicely into the current cultural paradigm;
    - It requires altruism at the individual scale; rather than coordination at the collective scale;
    - It aligns with the modern train of thought that innovation improves quality of life;
    - Socialism has been tried before; and despite immediate benefits, it is hard to maintain a state that is not corruptible.
    - Self-replication ensures that if such a unit is owned by any individual with a generous heart, there will not be a limited supply of the factors of production.


## Shortcomings of UBR
- Firstly, is it really practical to create a self-replicating device?
    - One must recognise that there are a limited set of resources available to us as a species: a limited amount of metals like copper and iron.
    - It may also be dangerous to operate self-replicating machines on a micro scale, because grey goo scenarios suck.
- UBR does not address market failure; i.e. it will still fail to provide goods like national defence, public healthcare and streetlamps. A government is still necessary.
- UBR assumes that inividuals are homogenous and have relatively constant needs.
    - This can be fixed by creating the system with a little 'room for extra', to allow for individual expression.
- We still need a miracle! There still needs to be someone who is able to create such a system and share it with everyone, whilst maintaining a full workload as a participant in the capitalist system.
