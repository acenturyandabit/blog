# On Bryan Jordan's Irony
## Contents
- In this article I tear apart Bryan Jordan's medium article on irony.
    - The article consists of ~30 assertions. 
        - At times a single concept e.g. familiarity, comfort and emotion are used interchangeably. 
        - I will endeavour to cut down the number of equivalent terms used to improve clarity.
    - I will also endeavour to cut down on the use of pronouns, as I do in my other work, to improve clarity.
    - I have also added a future work section.

## Executive summary
- The author defines living ironically as:
    - a performance, framed as comedy;
    - about what individuals cannot have, juxtaposed against their expectations.
- The author attributes living ironically to an education system that preaches conformity.
- The author criticises the tendency of individuals to not achieve 'more'
    - without explicitly defining what the standard against 'more' is measured against;
    - and without explicitly juxtaposing living ironically with achieving 'more'.

## Per-statement breakdown
1. Consider how many decisions you’ve made over the past week. How many of them were driven by what felt comfortable?
    - The author asserts that the majority of our day to day decisions are based on familiarity.

2. I don’t think that basing a decision on what feels familiar has to be bound to reason. 
    - The author contrasts familiar decisions as distinct from reason.

3. So if most people behave on the basis of what’s comfortable, isn’t this leading a life defined by emotion rather than one of reason?
    1. The author asserts that one's behavior defines the way they lead their life.
    2. The author links familiarity to emotion; which as in 2), is distinct from reason.
    3. The author implies that behaving based on emotion is inherently bad as it is distinct from reason.

4. I’ve often thought about how many people subscribe themselves to a life of irony — a constant performance about what they don’t have and framing it in comedy. 
    1. The author defines irony as 'a constant performance about what they don't have framed as comedy'.
    2. The author describes the ironic lifestyle as a subscription.

5. From what they post on Instagram, to what they watch and read in their spare time — how much of the lower and middle-class finds most of their entertainment in the discrepancy between expectations and reality?
    1. The author redefines irony as a 'discrepancy between expectations and reality'
        - This feels problematic to me because a discrepancy between expectations and reality, in contrast to 'a constant performance about what they don't have', adds an extra implication as below:
    2. ! If we take irony to be both a 'discrepancy between expectations and reality' AND 'a constant performance about what they don't have framed as comedy', there is an implicit assumption that what one doesn't have, one necessarily expects to have.
    - !D We shall interpret the author's following stance as a combination of these two definitions of irony: irony is a comedic performance about what inividuals do not have, juxtaposed against their expectations.
    - It may or may not be the author's intention to also connect 'comedy' and 'reality'; which would imply he believes that the 'lower and middle class' tend to believe that reality should be thought of as some tragic comedy.

6. This type of humour isn’t exclusive to those that simply can’t create a reality that matches their expectations 
    1. The author changes their [modality](https://education.nsw.gov.au/teaching-and-learning/student-assessment/smart-teaching-strategies/literacy/writing/stage-3/sentence-structure/identifying-and-using-modality): switching from critiquing the reality he believes his subjects 'don't have' to what they 'can't have'.
    2. The author also distinguishes himself from those who can't shape their reality to match their expectations.
    - !D Let's accept the present modality over the past one; i.e. we yet again redefine our definition of irony as a comedic performance about what inividuals CANNOT have, juxtaposed against their expectations.

7. — but it seems it’s far more pronounced and encouraged in lower and middle-class communities. 
    - This one is fairly self-explanatory; though I would encourage readers to replace the "it's" pronoun here with our explicit definition of irony as stated above.

8. In fact, because of its prevalence and the general compulsion to conform to social norms — it’s possible that such humour is a self-reinforcing cycle

9. , and its adoption ultimately becomes self-destructive.
    - Note: I have separated the sentence at this comma because I believe that the assertion that irony's adoption is self-destructive requires further proof.

10. After all — the most you can achieve is the most you can perceive.
    - This is an interesting statement because of the use of 'is'. How strong does the author believe this statement is?
        - Does the author believe that anything that can be perceived by an individual can be achieved by the individual?
        - Or does the author believe that only that which can be perceived by an individual can be achieved by the individual?

11. Jean-Jacques Rosseau’s Émile describes the translational effect educational system has on children by transcribing the social norms of today into the foundation-layers of tomorrow.
    - I have not read Emile but have heard of it from my English classes in high school.
    - I will assume that by mentioning the article as presented above, the author agrees with Rousseau that education transcribes the social normas of today into the foundation of the future. (A very Romantic way of seeing things, which I relate to, having studied the topic during high school.)

12. Perhaps it's the unquestionable value of community-building that we prescribe in the schooling system that spawns such a reliance in children to bind themselves to the expectations of today’s generation. 
    1. The author declares that the value of community-building is presented as unquestionable in our schooling system.
    2. The author declares that the value of community-building causes children to bind themselves to the expectations of today's generation.
        - I would ask: is schooling the only influence that causes children to bind themselves to the expectations of today's generation? 
            - Does whoever controls public education control the future of society?

13. Consequently, before this generation can progressively develop themselves, they’ve already succumbed to the influence of the older generation
    1. The author implies that individuals in a generation will, if left undisturbed, progressively develop themselves.
    2. The author implies that the influence of the older generation is suppressive to a progressive development of self;

14. and surrendered themselves to a life of irony — forever laughing at what they feel they can never achieve.
    1. The author implies that the act of adopting a life of irony is a surrender;
    2. Through the use of conjunction the author ties the blame on this surrender to the influence of the older generation.

15. One of the scariest realisations I’ve had over the past few months is how many people define themselves at around 18 years old. 
    1. The author declares that individuals tend to define themselves at around 18 years old; and
    2. The author implies, by mentioning 'scariest', that this is a bad thing;

15. After school, many people have a small amount of general independence

16. and I think many use that as an opportunity to formulate a sense of self 

17. despite the obvious limitations in resources and experience [that a person at the age of 18 is necessarily subject to].

18. But then if someone starts to begin pursuing a path of what they think is “their” path — at what point do they ever deviate from that path, let alone realise this is not “their” path. 
    1. The author implies that people take ownership of the journeys that they set upon
    2. The author implies that people tend to deviate from the journeys that they choose to set upon
    3. The author implies that people do not truly intend / are not the primary beneficiaries of the journeys they set upon.

19. I don’t think many do because of the confounding effects of having to abide by social norms 

20. [The confounding effects of having to abide by social norms] are often established at two primary time periods: at the beginning of high school, and the beginning of university.

21. So the unfortunate question for many is how young were you when gave up on aiming for more?
    1. The author implies that individuals innately aim for 'more';
        - but more than what is unclear: more than the restrictions imposed by the older generation? more than their ironic lifestyles?
    2. The author implies that individuals stop aiming for more at a certain age;
    3. The author implies that this is a bad thing, through the use of 'unfortunately'.

## Suggested further work
- In the analysis of the article presented above, a few key things stand out that could benefit from resolution:
1. I would appreciate it if the author clarified their modality of the discrepancy between expectations and reality in their definition (statement 10):
    - Is the author stating the fact of the difference between the expectations of the lower to middle class and their reality? Or is the author imparting some responsibility of this discrepancy on the lower to middle class?
    - I am deducing from the choice of modality and assertions in statement 10, that the author believes human agency to be the primary driving force in determining the outcome of an individual's life. 
    - This is known as the [sense of agency](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5002400/);
    - I would like to note that this varies greatly between different cultures; and encourage the author to explore their thoughts from the opposite viewpoint; i.e. ask: what if human agency weren't the dominant factor in determining someone's current position in life? 
    - Indeed, the author does not need to look very far to find potential challenges to the notion of agency as supreme: In statement 11 the author references Rousseau; if Rousseau's logic is to be followed, we cannot blame any schoolchildren's fate on their own agency but instead on the method of schooling they have been exposed to.
2. I would appreciate it if the author attempted to explain in more detail how the difference between expectations and reality is shaped into comedy. 
    - What is comedy? What kinds of comedy are there? Perhaps, for example, dark humour, the humour of relief, and pure, forgettable humour: what distinguishes them? And where does this ironic humour presented in the article fit in?
3. The author makes a number of general assertions that would benefit from a proof (i.e. a trace back to the axioms (i.e. base assumptions) that lead to the assertion presented), including:
    - That the adoption of an ironic mindset is self-destructive (statement 9);
    - That 'the most you can achieve is the most you can perceive' (statement 10);
    - That individuals in a generation, if left undisturbed, will progressively develop themselves (statement 13.1)
        - It would be interesting to see an attempt to define 'progressive development' - I have tried to do this with another friend but we were not able to determine a good definition.
    - That adopting a life of irony is surrender; (statement 14.1) but surrender to what? Where is the fight?
    - That blame ought to be placed on the older generation's values (14.2); of which the only one referenced is community-building (12.2)
    - That the majority of individuals set upon journeys that are not the most beneficial for them (given their personal circumstances) (18.3)
4. It would be beneficial if the author provides statistical, anecdotal or other evidence for the following observational assertions:
    - That individuals tend to define themselves at around 18 years old (15.1);
    - As well as any statement in the list of general assertions above that the author wishes to amend by appending a 'the majority of, but not all, individuals...' clause as prefix to.
5. It would be interesting for me to see the author pose a declaration of what progressive development is.
    - taking into consideration that thinkers from past generations have considered their own predecessors to be similarly suppressive of 'progressive development';
    - one would ask: why haven't we figured out progressiveness already?
    - furthermore, what notes should one keep, knowing that one day one will take on the role of the older generation that is criticised so in this article?
6. It would also be interesting for me to see the author pose what he believes to be the 'right way' to develop oneself given the constraints present at age 18.
7. I would appreciate if the author elaborated in more detail upon what confounding effects are presented by the need to abide by social norms, as critiqued in (19, 20).
