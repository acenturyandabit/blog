# What is intrinsic motivation? Does it actually exist?
- Ehssan, an older friend of mine, insists on a distinction between 'external' and 'intrinsic' motivation.
    - The proposed definition of intrinsic motivation was given as 'doing something despite a lack of external reward'.
    - The proposed benefits of intrinsic motivation is that it is 
        - A) highly accessible; that is, accessible irrespective of the nature of the activity.
        - B) more potent than regular external motivation. 
- In this article, I seek to prove that intrinsic motivation defined by those two characteristics (or mostly the first) does not actually exist.
- First, we should clarify our definition of intrinsic motivation by drawing the boundary between what is not intrinsic motivation.
    - We note that intrinsic motivation can be used alongside external motivation; for fairness' sake; 
        - hence, we cannot discount any activity from being free from intrinsic motivation simply because there is an attached external motivation.
    - Though one must be careful to define what 'external' means. For example, one could say that say eating cake is intrinsically motivated because there's no reward outside of the system of you and the cake;
        - but if we define intrinsic motivation as motivation free from reward external to the activity, then we might as well call it "activity-driven motivation"; and
        - it loses this magical property of being highly accessible despite the undesirability of the activity at hand.
        - It is worthwhile, though, to note that the notion of intrinsic motivation available on psychology websites like [this](https://www.verywellmind.com/differences-between-extrinsic-and-intrinsic-motivation-2795384) typically forgo A) in favour of a definition of intrinsic motivation as activity-dependent.
- Can we still provide evidence of the existence of activity-independent, reward-free motivation?
    - The burden is to prove specifically that there exists some observable motivation for an individual to perform an action where no external or action-related motivation exists. 
    - An issue with this definition is that by defining intrinsic motivation as external and not action-related, we cannot make any direct observations that tie an activity solely to intrinsic motivation;
        - in other words, all consistent efforts have some extrinsic motivation that can be attributed to either the activity or the results of preforming the activity.
    - Perhaps, then, we could try and isolate intrinsic motivation by discounting variations in external motivation?
        - that is, produce a scenario where two individuals perform exactly the same activity for exactly the same reward, so that we can discount their external motivation?
            - and therefore, their difference in motivation must be due to some intrinsic motivation, right?
- Well, there are two more factors we need to consider first:
    1. Opportunity cost; and 
    2. Individual value perceptions.
    - Opportunity cost is the ability for an agent to do something else with that same time.
        - I will argue that this amounts to external or activity dependent; especially if the difference in opportunity cost for two individuals is dependent on either
            - the reward to be gained (External); or 
            - the skill / cost of the activity to the indiviual (activity-depenedent).
        - Hence, we can discount opportunity cost from our definition of intrinsic motivation; though we cannot deny its effect.
    - Individual value perceptions are also strongly tied to external or activity-based motivation, as:
        - Even without a reward, our value systems shape our perception of the consequence of the activity or the provided external reward, and would be meaningless if the activity were nonspecific enough to not provide either consequence or reward;
        - and secondly, we note that individual value perceptions don't meet the requirement of A); that is, that individual value perceptions can be altered despite the nature of an activity. In short, one cannot expect to motivate a sociable, rational adult to dance wildy on the street by distorting their value perceptions, as we would expect from our definition of intrinsic motivation.
- Then we will ask ourselves again: does some intrinsic motivation that can be found independent of the task, the consequences of the task, and independent of the rewards provided alongside the task, independent of the phenomena listed above, actually exists?
    - My answer to that is no. That is, we cannot expect to inspire a different level of motivation in any individual by instilling an intrinsic motivation that is independent of activity, consequence, opportunity cost, personal values, or reward.

## Consequences
- It follows that if we cannot prove the existence of intrinsic motivation, then we should not attempt to promote it to our students.

## Footnote
- In researching intrinsic motivation I stumbled upon an interesting effect that is attributed to activity-based motivation, which is the overjustification effect. 
    - That is, by providing a reward external to a behaviour, one actually dissuades the behaviour rather than reinforcing it.
