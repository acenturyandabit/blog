# Terminal goals
I am going to critique some common terminal goals and state my own terminal goals.

General criticism for common terminal goals:
- They are too vague
- They are short sighted
- They make you, the actor, redundant

Common terminal goals:
1. Achieve a stable income and a target lifestyle
    - This is contingent on a lot of external factors. 
    - Also you'll probably have to do things you don't want to do to access things you want to do, whether they be morally questionable or otherwise.
    - Also, it's transient. You'll die one day.
2. Be financially independent
    - We live in a society. We can't be financially independent because we are not inherently independent. 
    - If you have to buy anything at all, then you're not financially independent. You are either fully independent, or you have to earn money for the rest of your life.
3. Make lots of money
    - You could sell half your body parts and make a looot of money. I see you're still here, not missing half your organs, so my guess is then your true terminal goal isn't actually 'make lots of money', but rather the benefits that go with it. See: 'Achieve a stable income and a target lifestyle (1)'.
4. Have kids
    - What values do you want your kids to have? can you reliably align them to these values? what if they don't align to these values?
        - If your answer is 'I want them to find their own values', imagine the most different set of values to your own. What if your kids adopted those values?
5. Do good by future generations
    - You can't really speak for future generations. See 'have kids'.

My terminal goals:
- Automate work, as much as possible. If you're doing it and you don't want to, it can be automated.
- Create digital intelligence. Something other than biology that is able to provide solutions to novel problems by performing research.
    - It is remarkably hard to get a human to accept an arbitrary terminal goal. In contrast, a machine will take whatever end goal you give it and not question it. 
    - Also, digital intelligence is far more scalable than human research. You can clone and fork digital agents.
- Live forever. 
    - [We have a promising lead on how to live forever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategies_for_Engineered_Negligible_Senescence), or at least how to extend our lives drastically.
    - I don't believe death gives life meaning. In fact, the opposite: I think death voids life of meaning. What if I asked you to create a wonderful sculpture and you knew I would melt it into slag the moment you were done? You probably wouldn't make the sculpture.
