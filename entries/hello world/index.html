# Hello world! 
I am blogging because I want to share my thoughts with the world in a structured and accessible way. 
I hope you will revisit this blog, or [contact me](mailto:steeven.liu2@gmail.com) if you find any of these articles useful.

Source code for this blog is available on [github](https://github.com/acenturyandabit/blog).
## Writing paradigm
I will be writing for people like me, who are good at filtering out relevant information; and I plan to make your job easy by minimising the amount of information I will write.

Here are my rules:
- Use lists frequently
- Otherwise, keep paragraphs to under 2 lines, if possible.
- Use as simple words as possible; if more complex words are used, define them.

### Future improvements
Here are some ideas:
- TLDRscript. Enable TLDR's so that readers can skip sections they are already familiar with.
- Structured writing.
